Here is my given task for the AI/ML Trainee internship opportunity.

At first, you need to install the packages used for the tasks like numpy, pandas and matplotlib.
create a virtual environment(optional) then install the packages in requirements.txt

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

1. For task1, **API Data Retrieval and Storage**, the code is in **api_data_retrieval** folder and for running the code, run the main.py file

```bash
python api_data_retrieval/main.py
```

2. For task2, **Data Processing and Visualization**, the code is in **data_process_and_visual** folder and for running the code, run the main.py file

```bash
python data_process_and_visual/main.py
```

3. For task3, **CSV Data Import to a Database**, the code is in **csv_data_to_database** folder and for running the code, run the main.py file

```bash

5. The previous code also contains database(postgresql) but I'll present another code that was my first big work with the database and one of my work from early days. Here is the link:
